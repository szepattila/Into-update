# Intro-update
I will update the intro for the public

Let's start from the beginning. At that time, in addition to basic DOS, I became familiar with the QuickBasic programming language. This was followed by HTML, CSS and JavaScript garnished with a little PHP.
I added Adobe Photoshop. Just a little trivia in image editing.
I thought I would expand my knowledge. In 2018, I was admitted to UWL (University of West London). Last but not least, Freddie Mercury also studied here!
During my first year at university, I started studying Python. I expanded - I updated my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. While learning about Picaxe, I became better acquainted with microcontrollers and microcomputers. Yes, in this case it's the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi, and the modules that can be attached to them. I'm having a lot of fun. One Raspberrymen is running Kali Linux.
Here we also take a step forward. I looked at Suse Linux a long time ago. But then I let go of the thing. With my current studies, Linux has once again come into view.
Namely Ubuntu and Kali linux. In the first round, I was thinking of machines installed separately. But then I got to know Oracle VM VirtualBox. Well, in this laboratory setting, I released the progs.
For the sake of curiosity, I also run Raspberry in this environment, for the sake of experimentation.
Ubuntum is also a SeedUbuntu lab.
I met VireShark in these circumstances.
I run it in VirtualBox and on my Kali machine.
I managed to make a closer acquaintance with the OpenCart system. I loved that too.
Through XAMPP, I immersed myself in editing the database and managing the database. Here phpMyAdmin was the base, and SQL - MySQL as the database. And DBeaver.
Returning to Python, which is in Python 3.9, Python IDLE in Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code.
Using NodeJS, I dealt with JavaScript again,
but somehow I prefer Notepad ++.
I got close with Java programming during BlueJ and Android Studio. Here Kotlin and C ++ became part of my knowledge.
Pros and cons. Pro is all about the acquired knowledge. I am very happy about it. The downside is no, maybe just that the programming is evolving as fast as it needs to be followed.
